# Risk Assessment for CLI Integration

This document identifies and assesses potential risks related to the integration of components from `swissknife_old`, `ipfs_accelerate_js`, and `ipfs_accelerate_py` into the SwissKnife CLI architecture. It provides strategies for mitigating these risks and contingency plans for addressing them if they materialize.

## Risk Evaluation Matrix

Risks are evaluated using the following scales:

**Impact**:
- **High**: Major disruption to integration timeline, significant code refactoring required, or major functionality compromised
- **Medium**: Moderate delays or scope adjustment needed, important but non-critical functionality affected
- **Low**: Minor delays or issues that can be addressed within planned margins

**Probability**:
- **High**: Likely to occur (>70% chance)
- **Medium**: May occur (30-70% chance)
- **Low**: Unlikely to occur (<30% chance)

**Priority**: Calculated based on Impact and Probability
- **Critical**: Requires immediate attention and mitigation planning
- **Significant**: Important to address with clear mitigation strategies
- **Moderate**: Should be monitored but lower priority

### Risk Tracking

Track risks using the following format:

| Risk ID | Description | Impact | Probability | Priority | Status | Mitigation Progress | Owner |

| TECH-01 | Node.js Compatibility | High | Medium | Critical | Active | 30% Complete | [Owner] |
| TECH-02 | Performance Degradation | Medium | Medium | Significant | Active | 10% Complete | [Owner] |

### Risk Response Triggers

Define specific metrics or events that trigger risk response:

- **Schedule Variance**: >10% behind schedule triggers timeline risk response

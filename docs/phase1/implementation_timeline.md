## Timeline Assumptions

This timeline is based on the following assumptions:

1. Development resources are available as specified
2. No major changes to the integration scope
3. No significant issues with source repository components
4. CLI-compatible alternatives exist for browser-specific functionality

## Timeline Contingency

A 20% contingency buffer is built into each phase to account for:

1. Unexpected technical challenges
2. Dependency resolution issues
3. Additional testing requirements
4. Integration complexities

## Timeline Tracking

Progress will be tracked using:

1. Weekly status updates
2. Milestone completion tracking
3. Burn-down charts for each phase
4. Risk assessment updates

## Conclusion

This implementation timeline provides a detailed roadmap for integrating components from source repositories into the SwissKnife CLI architecture. By following this timeline, we can ensure an orderly integration process with clear milestones and deliverables.

The phased approach allows for incremental development and testing, with each phase building on the capabilities of the previous ones. Regular milestone assessments will help identify any issues early and allow for appropriate adjustments to the timeline.

## Critical Path Analysis

Based on the dependencies outlined in the roadmap and this timeline, the critical path likely involves:

1.  **Phase 1:** Foundational Documentation (Architecture, APIs).
2.  **Phase 2:** Core `TypeScriptAgent`, `IPFSKitClient`, `StorageService`, `ModelRegistry`.
3.  **Phase 3:** Core `TaskScheduler`, `GoT Engine`.
4.  **Phase 4:** `Command System` implementation, Integration of core services into CLI commands.
5.  **Phase 5:** Final Testing and Release Prep.

Delays in these core service implementations or the command system integration will directly impact the overall project timeline.

## Dependencies

*(See `cli_integration_roadmap.md` for a visual dependency graph)*

### External Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose | Risk Level | Notes |
|------------|---------|------------|-------|
| Node.js (>=18.x) | Runtime environment | Low | Assumed stable |
| IPFS Kit MCP Server | External Storage/Memory | Medium | Availability, API stability |
| External AI APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic) | Model Providers | Medium | Availability, Cost, API changes |
| Native Build Tools (Python, C++) | For Native Node Modules | Medium | Installation complexity for users/CI |
| OS Keychain Access | Secure Credential Storage | Low | Requires `keytar` or similar (native) |

### Internal Dependencies

*(Primary dependencies driving the phase structure)*
- **Phase 2 depends on Phase 1:** Core implementation requires architectural design and API specs.
- **Phase 3 depends on Phase 2:** TaskNet enhancements build upon core Agent, Storage, and Model services.
- **Phase 4 depends on Phase 2 & 3:** CLI commands require the underlying services to be functional.
- **Phase 5 depends on Phase 4:** Optimization and finalization require a feature-complete CLI.

## Timeline Assumptions

This timeline is based on the following assumptions:

1.  Development resources (as specified) are available and dedicated.
2.  The scope defined in Phase 1 remains relatively stable.
3.  No major unforeseen technical blockers arise during reimplementation or integration.
4.  External dependencies (IPFS Kit Server, AI APIs) are available and stable.
5.  Team has or can quickly acquire necessary skills (TypeScript, Node.js, specific libraries).

## Timeline Contingency

A contingency buffer (approx. 15-20%, integrated implicitly via slightly generous task estimates per week) should be considered within each phase to account for:
-   Unexpected technical challenges (e.g., debugging native modules).
-   Dependency resolution issues.
-   More complex-than-anticipated refactoring/reimplementation.
-   Integration complexities.
-   Scope creep (to be managed tightly).

## Timeline Tracking

Progress will be tracked using:
-   **Weekly Syncs:** Review completed tasks, identify blockers, adjust next week's plan.
-   **Issue Tracker:** Tasks broken down into issues/tickets, tracked via boards (e.g., GitHub Projects, Jira).
-   **Milestone Reviews:** Formal review at the end of each Phase to ensure deliverables are met before proceeding.
-   **Risk Register:** Regularly update the `risk_assessment.md` based on progress and new findings.

## Conclusion

This implementation timeline provides a detailed week-by-week projection for the SwissKnife CLI integration project, aligned with the 5-phase structure from the roadmap. It outlines specific tasks, dependencies, and milestones necessary to achieve the project's objectives.

Adherence to this timeline, combined with proactive risk management and regular progress tracking, will be crucial for successfully delivering a high-quality, integrated SwissKnife CLI application within the projected 14-week timeframe. Flexibility will be required to adapt to challenges encountered during development.

## Conclusion

This implementation timeline provides a detailed roadmap for integrating components from source repositories into the SwissKnife CLI architecture. By following this timeline, we can ensure an orderly integration process with clear milestones and deliverables.

The phased approach allows for incremental development and testing, with each phase building on the capabilities of the previous ones. Regular milestone assessments will help identify any issues early and allow for appropriate adjustments to the timeline.

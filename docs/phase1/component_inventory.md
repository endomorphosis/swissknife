# Component Inventory for CLI Integration

This document catalogs all components from the source repositories (`swissknife_old`, `ipfs_accelerate_js`, and `ipfs_accelerate_py`) and assesses their compatibility with SwissKnife's CLI architecture.

## Compatibility Assessment Criteria

Each component is evaluated against the following criteria:

- **Compatible**: Can be integrated with minimal changes, already works in Node.js/CLI environment
- **Requires Adaptation**: Can be integrated but needs significant modifications for CLI compatibility
- **Incompatible**: Cannot be reasonably adapted for CLI use, typically due to browser dependencies

## Priority Levels

- **High**: Core functionality needed in the near term
- **Medium**: Important but not immediately critical
- **Low**: Nice-to-have features or experimental

## Complexity Assessment

- **High**: Significant technical challenges, dependencies, or architectural changes
- **Medium**: Moderate effort required, some challenges expected
- **Low**: Straightforward integration with minimal challenges

2. **Modified**: Hardware detection optimized for maximum neural network inference performance in CLI
3. **Excluded**: Browser-specific UI components that aren't applicable to CLI environments
4. **Modified**: Storage APIs focused on efficient neural network model handling in Node.js
5. **Excluded**: WebRTC communication in favor of CLI-appropriate communication protocols
6. **Excluded**: Browser rendering engines in favor of terminal-based output
7. **Modified**: Resource management specifically optimized for ML model execution in Node.js
8. **Excluded**: Cross-browser compatibility code in favor of CLI environment optimizations

The focus is on creating a highly optimized CLI tool that can run neural networks directly, providing powerful AI inference capabilities through a command-line interface rather than a browser environment.

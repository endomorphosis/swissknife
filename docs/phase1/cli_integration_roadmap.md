# CLI Integration Roadmap

This document provides a high-level overview of the integration roadmap for merging functionality from Goose (reimplemented in TypeScript), IPFS Kit MCP Server, and other components into the current SwissKnife CLI architecture. It outlines major phases, milestones, and the strategic direction for the integration effort.

## Strategic Objectives

The CLI integration effort is guided by the following strategic objectives:

1. **Clean Room TypeScript Implementation**: Create independent TypeScript implementations of all functionality using clean room methodology rather than direct Rust code translation (see [../CLEAN_ROOM_IMPLEMENTATION.md](../CLEAN_ROOM_IMPLEMENTATION.md))
2. **Tight Coupling with SwissKnife**: Ensure integrated components are tightly coupled with the SwissKnife system
3. **IPFS Kit MCP Server Integration**: Use IPFS Kit MCP Server as the primary storage/memory medium
4. **Enhanced Task Processing**: Incorporate tasknet enhancements for improved task decomposition and delegation
5. **Maintain CLI-First Focus**: Ensure all integrated components prioritize the command-line interface and Node.js environment
6. **Optimize Performance**: Ensure CLI operations are efficient, responsive, and resource-conscious

2. **Interface-Driven Design**: Define clear interfaces before implementation to ensure coherence
3. **Test-Driven Development**: Implement comprehensive tests for each component
4. **Documentation Alongside Code**: Create documentation as components are developed
5. **Performance-Conscious Implementation**: Optimize TypeScript code for performance where critical

## Component Dependencies

The integration recognizes these critical dependencies:

```
TypeScript Agent System → Tool System → Command Interface
IPFS Kit MCP Client → Storage Operations → Data Management
Graph-of-Thought → Task Scheduling → Task Delegation
```

These dependencies drive the phase ordering and integration sequence.

## Technical Architecture Overview

The integration will implement a layered architecture in TypeScript:

## Risk Management Summary

Major integration risks and mitigation strategies include:

1. **TypeScript Performance**: Identify and optimize critical paths, use efficient data structures
2. **IPFS Kit MCP Server Integration**: Robust error handling, clear interface definition
3. **Graph-of-Thought Complexity**: Incremental implementation, thorough testing
4. **TypeScript-to-Python Communication**: Well-defined protocols, robust serialization
5. **Feature Parity**: Comprehensive analysis of Goose features, thorough validation

## Conclusion

This CLI Integration Roadmap provides a strategic overview of the effort to reimplement Goose features in TypeScript, integrate with IPFS Kit MCP Server, and enhance the system with advanced task processing capabilities. By following this roadmap, we will systematically build a powerful, tightly integrated SwissKnife system with sophisticated AI agent functionality.

The phased approach ensures that we build a solid foundation in TypeScript before adding more sophisticated capabilities, resulting in a coherent, high-quality product. Regular assessments will help us stay on track and adapt as needed to changing circumstances or discoveries during the implementation process.

# CLI Integration Roadmap

This document provides a high-level strategic overview and timeline for the entire SwissKnife integration project, encompassing the reimplementation of Goose features in TypeScript, integration with the IPFS Kit MCP Server, and the incorporation of TaskNet enhancements into a unified CLI architecture. It outlines the major phases, key milestones, and guiding principles for the development effort.

## Strategic Objectives

The CLI integration effort is guided by the following strategic objectives:

1. **Clean Room TypeScript Implementation**: Independently implement required functionality in TypeScript, based on understanding the *behavior* of source components, not direct code translation. Ensures an idiomatic, maintainable codebase free from source code licensing constraints. (See [../CLEAN_ROOM_IMPLEMENTATION.md](../CLEAN_ROOM_IMPLEMENTATION.md)).
2. **Tight Internal Coupling**: Design core SwissKnife components (Agent, Task System, etc.) to integrate closely within the Node.js process for efficiency.
3. **Loose External Coupling (IPFS Kit)**: Integrate with the IPFS Kit MCP Server via its defined API, treating it as an external dependency.
4. **Enhanced Task Processing**: Implement advanced TaskNet features (GoT, scheduling, decomposition, delegation) for sophisticated workflow management.
5. **CLI-First & Node.js Native**: Prioritize the command-line user experience and leverage Node.js runtime capabilities, excluding browser-specific APIs.
6. **Performance & Optimization**: Build an efficient, responsive CLI, optimizing critical paths and resource usage (memory, startup time).

## Integration Phases Overview

The integration will proceed through five major phases, each building on the previous ones to create a cohesive, powerful CLI application.

### Phase 1: Analysis and TypeScript Architecture Design (Weeks 1-2)

**Focus**: Analyze source components, define the target TypeScript architecture, and plan the integration.

**Key Activities**:
- Analyze source features (`swissknife_old`, `ipfs_accelerate_js/py`) for CLI relevance and reimplementation requirements.
- Design the core TypeScript architecture (services, layers, modules - see `cli_architecture.md`).
- Define key TypeScript interfaces (`api_specifications.md`) for major components (Agent, Storage, Task, ModelProvider, etc.).
- Define the interface/client strategy for IPFS Kit MCP Server communication.
- Develop the overall CLI Test Strategy (`cli_test_strategy.md`) and plan template (`test_plan_template.md`).
- Establish coding standards, documentation structure, and project setup.
- Perform initial risk assessment (`risk_assessment.md`) and technical challenge analysis (`technical_challenges.md`).
- Create component inventory (`component_inventory.md`) and mapping (`component_mapping.md`).

**Major Milestones**:
- Completion of Phase 1 Documentation (Analysis, Architecture, APIs, Strategy, Plan, Risks, Mapping).
- Agreed-upon TypeScript architecture and core interfaces.
- Established project standards and testing framework outline.

**Strategic Value**: This phase establishes the foundation for TypeScript implementation, ensuring a clear path for reimplementing Goose functionality.

- Core component tests passing.

**Strategic Value**: These core components provide the essential functionality in TypeScript that will power the enhanced CLI capabilities.

### Phase 3: TaskNet Enhancement Integration (Weeks 7-9)

**Focus**: Implementing the advanced TaskNet features for complex workflow management.

**Key Activities**:
- Implement the `GraphOfThought` engine, including node types, processors, and reasoning strategies.
- Implement the `FibonacciHeap` scheduler (`TaskScheduler`) and dynamic priority calculation.
- Implement the `DecompositionEngine` and `SynthesisEngine` with various strategies.
- Implement the `DependencyManager` for tracking task relationships.
- Implement the local `WorkerPool` using Node.js `worker_threads`.
- Implement the distributed coordination layer (`MerkleClock`, Hamming distance, Libp2p integration via a `NetworkService`).
- Integrate GoT, Decomposition, Scheduling, and Execution/Delegation components.
- Develop unit and integration tests for TaskNet components.

**Major Milestones**:
- Functional Graph-of-Thought engine integrated with Agent/Tasks.
- Functional Task Scheduling and local parallel execution via Worker Pool.
- Functional Task Decomposition and Result Synthesis.
- Initial implementation of distributed task coordination (Merkle Clock, Hamming Distance).

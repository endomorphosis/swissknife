# Phase 1 Documentation Plan: Analysis and Planning

This document outlines the documentation deliverables for Phase 1 of the SwissKnife integration project, which focuses on merging functionality from `swissknife_old` and applicable components from `ipfs_accelerate_js`/`ipfs_accelerate_py` into the current implementation.

## Core Principles

- **CLI-First Architecture**: SwissKnife is fundamentally a CLI application running in Node.js environments.
- **Server-Side Focus**: All documentation and integration plans must prioritize server-side execution models.
- **Selective Integration**: Only components compatible with or adaptable to a CLI environment will be considered.
- **Node.js Compatibility**: All integrated components must function within Node.js runtime constraints.

# SwissKnife CI/CD System

This document provides comprehensive information about the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) system used in the SwissKnife project.

## Overview

The SwissKnife CI/CD system automates building, testing, and deploying the SwissKnife application across different environments. It ensures code quality, performs comprehensive testing, and provides reliable deployment automation.

```

## CI Workflow

The CI workflow (`ci.yml`) runs on every push to main/develop branches and on pull requests. It ensures code quality and produces verified builds.

### CI Jobs

1. **Validate & Lint**
   - Checks code formatting
   - Performs linting
   - Type checking
   - Generates documentation

2. **Test**
   - Runs unit tests
   - Runs integration tests
   - Runs end-to-end tests
   - Runs specialized tests for critical components (Graph-of-Thought, Fibonacci Heap)
   - Generates coverage reports

3. **Security Scan**
   - Runs npm audit
   - Performs Snyk security scanning

4. **Build**
   - Creates production build
   - Verifies build functionality
   - Uploads build artifacts

5. **Benchmark** (on push to main/develop only)
   - Runs performance benchmarks
   - Compares with previous results

## CD Workflow

The CD workflow (`cd.yml`) handles deployment to different environments.

### CD Jobs

1. **Prepare Deployment**
   - Determines environment and version

2. **Deploy to Staging**
   - Runs when targeting staging environment
   - Configures for staging
   - Deploys to staging server
   - Runs post-deployment tests
   - Sends notifications

3. **Deploy to Production**
   - Runs when targeting production environment
   - Configures for production
   - Deploys to production server
   - Creates deployment record
   - Sends notifications

4. **Publish to npm**
   - Runs after successful production deployment
   - Publishes package to npm registry

## Environment Configuration

The system supports two environments:

1. **Staging**
   - Used for testing before production
   - Has debug mode enabled
   - Experimental features enabled
   - Uses staging API endpoints

2. **Production**
   - Production-ready configuration
   - Debug mode disabled
   - Only stable features
   - Uses production API endpoints

## Required Secrets

The following GitHub Actions secrets need to be configured:

| Secret Name | Description | Used In |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `STAGING_API_URL` | Staging API endpoint URL | Staging deployment |
| `STAGING_API_KEY` | API key for staging | Staging deployment |
| `STAGING_DEPLOY_TOKEN` | Deployment token for staging | Staging deployment |
| `PRODUCTION_API_URL` | Production API endpoint URL | Production deployment |
| `PRODUCTION_API_KEY` | API key for production | Production deployment |
| `PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_TOKEN` | Deployment token for production | Production deployment |
| `NPM_TOKEN` | npm authentication token | npm publishing |
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | Slack webhook for notifications | Both workflows |
| `SNYK_TOKEN` | Snyk API token for security scanning | CI workflow |

## Scripts

The CI/CD system uses several custom scripts:

1. **configure.js**
   - Sets up environment-specific configuration
   - Creates .env file with correct variables
   - Usage: `node scripts/configure.js [staging|production]`

2. **deploy.js**
   - Handles deployment to different environments
   - Creates deployment packages
   - Simulates/performs deployment operations
   - Usage: `node scripts/deploy.js [staging|production]`

3. **verify-build.js**
   - Verifies the build output is functional
   - Runs smoke tests on the built CLI
   - Usage: `node test/verify-build.js`

4. **run.js (benchmarks)**
   - Runs performance benchmarks
   - Compares with previous benchmark results
   - Usage: `node benchmark/run.js`

## Testing Configuration

The project uses Jest for testing with separate configurations:

1. **jest.config.js**
   - Main Jest configuration for all tests

2. **jest.staging.config.js**
   - Configuration for staging environment tests
   - Used during post-deployment testing

## Using the CI/CD System

### Running Locally

To run CI/CD jobs locally for testing:

```bash
# Run CI checks
npm run format:check
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e
npm run build
npm run test:verify-build

# Configure and deploy to staging
npm run config:staging
npm run deploy:staging

# Configure and deploy to production
npm run config:production
npm run deploy:production
```

### Triggering Deployments

#### Automatic Deployments
- Merges to `main` branch automatically deploy to staging
- Release publications automatically deploy to production

#### Manual Deployments
1. Go to the Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "SwissKnife CD (Deployment)"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select branch, environment, and optional version
5. Click "Run workflow"

## Setting Up GitHub Actions Secrets

To set up the required secrets:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings"
3. Select "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Click "New repository secret"
5. Add each of the secrets listed in the "Required Secrets" section

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check the build logs for specific errors
   - Verify that all dependencies are installed
   - Ensure code passes linting and type checking

2. **Test Failures**
   - Review test logs for failed tests
   - Run tests locally to reproduce issues
   - Check if tests are environment-specific

3. **Deployment Failures**
   - Verify environment secrets are correctly set
   - Check network access to deployment servers
   - Validate authentication tokens

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues with the CI/CD system:

1. Check the workflow run logs for detailed error messages
2. Review this documentation for correct usage
3. Contact the DevOps team for assistance with persistent problems

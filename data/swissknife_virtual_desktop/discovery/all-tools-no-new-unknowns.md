Decision: **NO-GO**

## No new unknowns

**No new unknowns.** Every blocker is assigned to an existing SVD task class.

## Phase-four gate accounting

| Gate | Owner task | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `representative_app_gate` | SVD-047 | blocked |
| `exhaustive_all_tools_gate` | SVD-057 | blocked |
| `all_tools_route_orb_glasses` | SVD-047 | blocked |
| `accelerate_adapter_boundary` | SVD-044 | blocked |
| `browser_compatible_app_smoke` | SVD-058 | blocked |
| `meta_glasses_simulator` | SVD-059 | blocked |

## Closeout integrity

- Status: **passed**
- Explicit blockers: 18
- Owner-assigned blockers: 18
- NO-GO contains only explicit blockers with an existing SVD task class, named owner, scope, reason, and evidence path.

## Task-class conclusion

Every open release gap is assigned to an existing SVD task class and named queue owner; no new unknown task class was introduced.
This ledger does not create follow-up task classes; it records only the existing owner task for each unsatisfied gate.
